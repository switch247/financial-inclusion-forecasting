# Documentation

This folder contains documentation and guidance tailored to the Ethiopia financial-inclusion forecasting challenge.

Contents:
- `README.md` — this file (overview & links)
- `business_understanding.md` — context and problem framing
- `dependencies.md` — environment and dependency notes
- `notebooks.md` — notebook workflow and task mapping (Task 1–5)

Guidance:
- Use `docs/notebooks.md` for the recommended notebook workflow for Tasks 1–5 (data enrichment, EDA, event-impact modeling, forecasting, dashboard).
- Keep task-specific notes, data-enrichment logs, and methodology documents in `experiments/` and `reports/`.
- Track dataset modifications in `data/data_enrichment_log.md` (create when enriching).

Refer to the top-level `README.md` and `experiments/todo.md` for full task requirements and submission deadlines.
